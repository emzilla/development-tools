# Tools I Use

I am starting a new job next week and I've been thinking about my personal development setup and what I use at a base level to do my job every day. Having the challenge of setting up a brand new machine made me see the need to document the essential applications, plugins, and details for my workflow. I'm pretty particular about what I use, even down to my erasers, a mindset I often attribute to Design school.
